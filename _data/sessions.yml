  title: GitHub Administration with Terraform
  service: ""
  subtype: ""
  description: "It's rare to find someone from cloud-native or DevOps or SRE space, who hasnâ€™t heard of Terraform and its capabilities. Today, we will go through one of the ways you can use this tool to make your life easy around Github. The one basic skill that everyone in the IT industry starts to learn first is using Git and moreover Github. Sometimes people use them interchangeably. In any big organization, GitHub is the single source of truth where resides the entire code for all the teams. Organizing that huge code is a challenge and automating it is a demanding need. Onboarding new users, creating teams, managing their permissions and creating new repositories every now and then becomes a BAU task. This all can be automated by a single tool TERRAFORM, which has been a popular choice being cloud agnostic in the IaaC field. Using the GitHub provider of Terraform can make it possible. Create new repositories, new teams, add users, archive a repository, and add or remove webhooks from repositories all these types of mundane but critical tasks we can automate using terraform. We will walk together to learn how we can create a self-service Infrastructure for Github."

  title: Why we chose a columnar database to build an open-source observability tool?
  service: ""
  subtype: ""
  description: "80% of the queries on logs are aggregation queries in Uber.
Running on-demand aggregates on your data-rich events with the power to slice and dice the data based on hypothesis creates the backbone of an observability system.

In the talk, I will present challenges in observability data management and how a distributed columnar database fits the needs."

  description: "There has been 12,286% rise in Bug bounty reports related to Cloud Misconfigurations (HackerOne Report 2021).
This can be solved by implementing a rich context graph across our CI/CD pipeline, which maps the exact relationships and dependencies of infrastructure across the entirety of the product lifecycle - starting from infrastructure creation (IaC) all the way to applications running in the cloud."

  description: "Kubernetes security is challenging! Pod Security Policy (PSP) is now replaced by Pod Security Admission (PSA) to help provide secure defaults. While PSP allowed granular controls, PSA operates at the namespace level. Let's discuss how you can configure security constraints for specific pods or controls using PSA and Kyverno."

  title: Enforcing Security Best Practices using CI
  service: ""
  subtype: ""
  description: "High-performing teams usually ship faster, better, secure and often! Organizations irrespective of their level, focusing on stability and continuous delivery ( CD ), will deploy frequently.
Hundreds of continuous integration ( CI ) build run for every organization on a typical day. This means your code and system is more prone to bugs, accidental data exposure, third party vulnerabilities and hence open doors for attackers.

Hence to ensure that we are shipping quality and secure code, we should integrate security checking in our CI. This talk will be about enforcing security best practices using CI"
