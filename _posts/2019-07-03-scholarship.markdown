About the scholarship
------------

1. The idea of the scholarship is to have people from different races, gender attend the conference. So the scholarship is strictly for people in the industry from the under-represented community (women and LGBTIQ).
2. Five scholarship slots are available, provided on the First-come, first-served basis
3. This scholarship only covers the conference tickets for 13th and 14th Sept. Additional expenses, if any,  should be borne by the attendee.
4. Provide as many details about yourself, so that we organisers are clear about why you need the scholarship to attend the conference.
5. Thank you Gitlab for sponsoring Diversity Scholarship. Make sure to meet the Gitlab team and thank them for providing this opportunity.
