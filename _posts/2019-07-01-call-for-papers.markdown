DevOpsDays India has been bringing the community together since 2011 as Indian Chapter of the movement started by Patrick Debois. Breaking the silos of different sequentially lined-up teams from Devs to Ops to make Continuous Delivery the primary focus.

#### Presenters – who should speak at the DevopsDays India Conference?

We have CFP open till 30th June 2017 with Speakers having enough time to propose a talk.

We are looking for submissions under all 3 traditional categories

Lightening Talk (5-10min)

Talk (30-45 min)

Workshop (>60min)

The topics can vary from further emphasis on DevOps philosophy to nerd internals of an awesome utility from the toolbox.

It can be having fun with containers or fierce scale cluster handling petabytes of data.

Or just some new monitoring/logging/analytics/automation framework you’re building or got introduced to.

If you have ideas for multiple talk proposals, do submit them separately.

Code of Conduct:

No sponsored vendor talks. If your content is community worthy, it has a chance of selection.

#### Please submit your proposals [here](https://www.papercall.io/dodi19).
__Deadline__ is July 31, 2019

__Please note:__ There is no guarantee that a submission will be put onto the conference agenda!<br/>

The program committee picks the most interesting talk proposals and informs the selected submitters until August 10, 2019.<br/>
